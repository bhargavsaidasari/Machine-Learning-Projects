This is my work for the Computer Vision Hackathon hosted by Analytics Vidhya where the task is to accurately classifiy a Emergency Vehicle in a picture.

This approach employs a EfficientNet-B2 with CyclicLR, Label Smoothing, K-Fold Cross Validation, Snapshot Ensembling ,and Test-Time Augmentation. The final score for this model on the private set was 96.8 %.
